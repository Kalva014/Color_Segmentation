# Color_Segmentation
I trained a model to detect orange cones in images and find the relative world coordinates of the cone
from images. 

I implement algorithms that learn the color model, segment the target color, and finally localize the target object from images. I used a set of training images, which I hand-labeled and from these training examples, I built a color classifier and orange cone detector. I created algorithms that marked the center of the detected orange cone and display the distance to the cone on new test images.
